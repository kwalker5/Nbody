# Nbody
Assignment 1: <br />
N Body ProblemThis assignment tests your knowledge of Lists by requiring that you generate a model for the movementof celestial bodies in 2-dimensions.<br />
Background:<br />
<br />
The n-body problem is the problem of taking the initial positions and velocities of “n” celestial bodies
and predicting their subsequent positions and motions using Newtonian laws of motion and gravity.
Where “n” is greater than 2, no closed-form solution exists to this problem, so a simulation (or
something similar) is required to predict the precise positions of the celestial bodies in question.<br />
<br />
Requirements:<br />
Your implementation must read the data file containing the details of several celestial bodies and
simulate the motion and effects of gravity on the bodies. Your implementation must use two different
implementations of the List data structure. Individual requirements for your implementation are detailed
below.<br />
<br />
The file MyLists.java contains my list interface, my ArrayList, and my LinkedList class.<br />
The file Nbody.java reads the file as well as drawing the ovals and making them move.
